In this repo I will store configuration files and some other util
files, which can be linked directly or through gnu stow.

Structure description:
* common
  Common files like bashrc.
* common/latex
  Config files for latex, org mode latex, etc.
* work-U
  Old files specific to work with proxy.
  

* Adding new files 
  What to do when adding a new file which is not linked?
  When everything is fine:
  - Add it to the repo: git add ...
  - Make the commit: git commit -m "..."
  - stow it (this assumes that the file was created under the folder "common"): 
  stow common
