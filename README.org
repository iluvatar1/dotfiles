In this repo I will store configuration files and some other util
files, which can be linked directly or through gnu stow.

* Structure description:
** common
Common files like bashrc.
** common/latex
Config files for latex, org mode latex, etc.
** work-U
Old files specific to work with proxy.

* Adding new files 
What to do when adding a new file which is not linked?
When everything is fine:
- Add it to the repo: git add ...
- Make the commit: git commit -m "..."
- stow it (this assumes that the file was created under the folder "common"):
  #+begin_src shell
  # stow common
  stow -n -t ~/ -v  common/
  #+end_src
